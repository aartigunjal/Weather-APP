# Weather-APP
Developed a responsive web-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an external API. The app displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions based on user input (city/location). Implemented clean UI design with CSS styling and JavaScript for API integration and dynamic updates.
